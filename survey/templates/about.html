For Doumit Days 2018 we are planning to take a cruise to Alaska.

The grandparents are getting old, and the family is getting big.
Instead of roping one of us into doing all the dishes, we'll get a 
cruise line to take care of us.

We'll leave out of Seattle to make it easy for everyone. 

More information about excursions will come later.

The prices below include everything except excursions. Because we are 
will be buying so many tickets, we will probably get completely free
food and drinks.
